# Telegram Product Analysis and Experiments

## **1. User Journey**

### **Initial Experience**
- I started using Telegram because of its speed, simple interface, and the promise of privacy. It felt more intuitive than WhatsApp 
and the addition of special functions and bots was helpful for fun.
- Setting up the app was seamless, with a quick phone number verification. I immediately noticed how easy it was to sync across devices.
Using WhatsApp between devices can have more friction.

- I now use Telegram daily for personal communication with close friends.
- **Key features I love:**
  - **Group Chats & Channels:** Large groups for discussions, friend groups, and interests.
  - **Cloud Storage:** The "Saved Messages" feature acts as a personal cloud for notes and files.
  - **Speed & Reliability:** Messages deliver instantly, even on weak networks.
  - **Bots:** From productivity bots to fun mini-games, they enhance the experience.
  - **Privacy Options:** End-to-end encrypted Secret Chats and the ability to self-destruct messages.
